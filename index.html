        <strong>About This Work:</strong>
        <p>"Celestial Mechanics" is a Three.js-based digital universe that artfully combines physics with visual
            aesthetics within a simulated space. At the center of this interactive experience is a detailed, futuristic
            car that rotates to showcase its design. Orbiting around this central car are three geometric forms—a
            sphere, a cube, and a cylinder—each following a path dictated by the car's gravitational influence.
            Additionally, upon each page load, a variety of shapes are randomly positioned and colored, each rotating
            independently to add layers of complexity and spontaneity to the scene. Dynamic lighting further enhances
            the visual depth and texture, creating a visually engaging and rich experience.
